# Productivity Tips Project Tracking

## Project Tracking

* Use Logseq to create a GUID for every project.
  * Logseq creates a GUID for every block in the database.
  * You can create a page to list projects on separate lines, and then use the block address for each project to tag all notes and emails for a project in other places like OneNote, Outlook, and other documents. Then you can use the tag to search for content related to each project.
  * I've found other ways to create a GUID, but Logseq might be the one of the easiest because it's already create a GUID for every block.
